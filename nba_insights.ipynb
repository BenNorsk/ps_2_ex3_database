    "## The remarkable story of the rise of the 3-point shot\n",
    "In the last 30 years of the NBA, the 3-point shot became increasingly popular. At the forefront of this rise stands Steph Curry, the baby-faced assasin from the Golden States Warriors. Few have made the 3-point focused playing style look so appealing as Curry. However, the 3-point shot has been on the rise long before Curry's first appearance (in 2009 with the Warriors). This notebook examines the story of the 3-point shot using four insights drawn from NBA data."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "To conclude, the 3-point shot has seen a rising relevance in the NBA over the past 20 years. Its importance for winning games leads teams to continuously improve the 3-pointer skills of their players. A demonstration of the power of the 3-pointer is found in the case of the Golden State Warriors, which dominated the Western Conference and the NBA between 2015 - 2019. One significant factor of their dominance may be attributed to their team's exceptional ability to hit 3-point shots."
